Graviton is a simple an easy to use migration tool. It allows you to define
migrations in a migrations folder then run them against your database.

It goes beyond a single database and allows you to define multiple
connections. With each connection you can specify a migrations folder.

Even though Graviton is written in go, migrations are written in TypeScript.
This means you don't need to compile your migrations or the tool itself. All
that is needed is the Graviton configuration for your project, one or more
migrations folders, and the Graviton binary.
